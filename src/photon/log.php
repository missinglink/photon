/**
 * Logging module.
 *
 * Logging is important, really important, you must log everything in
 * your application and rotate your logs. This will not cost you that
 * much performance penalty but will save your day when you will need
 * to debug or predict growth.
 *
 * Logs in an application can be collected for later writing or
 * directly sent to the backend. Photon provides file, MongoDB and zmq
 * logging backends. You can easily write your own or even chain
 * them. Chaining of backends allow you to write to a main backend and
 * fail over a second one in case of failure of the main backend.
 *
 * The usage is has one would expect:
 *
 * <pre>
 * \photon\log\Log::plog('Whatever you want to log.'); // Log::ALL level
 * \photon\log\Log::info('Whatever you want to log.');
 * \photon\log\Log::debug('Debug information.');
 * \photon\log\Log::fatal('Runtime situation which may crash the app.');
 * </pre>
 *
 * The log levels in priority order are:
 *
 * - `Log::ALL`: Lowest level, for low level debbugging.
 * - `Log::DEBUG`: Recommended for debug information.
 * - `Log::INFO`: Not so detailed as debug information but interesting.
 * - `Log::PERF`: You should always start to log at this level.
 * - `Log::EVENT`: Application events, maybe creation of an item or so.
 * - `Log::WARN`: Warning, something could break, need to review.
 * - `Log::ERROR`: Application error, the user is normally getting a 501.
 * - `Log::FATAL`: Fatal error leading to application crash.
 * - `Log::OFF`: Logging is disabled.
 *
 * For each lever a corresponding `Log::level` method is
 * available. For example, `Log::event('New sign up!')`.
 *
 * The real interesting part of the logging is that it directly
 * serialize the information as JSON. Serialized JSON is easy to read
 * for a human and easy to parse for a program. This way you can log:
 *
 * \photon\log\Log::debug(array('Remote call' => 'http://foo', 
 *                              'return_code' => 200));
