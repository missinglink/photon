title: Testing a Photon Component, Application or Project
description:
Automated testing improves the software quality by preventing regressions
in the code. After and while implementing new features, you create and run
the software unit tests to ensure that you do not break anything and that
the software runs as expected. Photon provides an easy way to run your tests.

# Introduction

Software testing is a very large field but the goal is always the
same, getting a software with the minimum number of bugs and doing
what it is supposed to do.

**Photon** provides you with some tools to help you perform some of
the testing of your software, the tools covers:

- Unit testing with [PHPUnit][phpunit];
- Code coverage analysis with [PHPUnit][phpunit] and [X-Debug][xdebug];
- Continuous integration (planned);
- Performance analysis.

You will need to manage yourself all the end user testing and in
browser testing.

# How to Run the Unit Tests

The unit tests with **Photon** are conventional [PHPUnit][phpunit]
tests. Go in project folder, where the `config.test.php` is available
and simply run:

    $ photon runtests
    PHPUnit 3.5.5 by Sebastian Bergmann.
    
    ..
    
    Time: 1 second, Memory: 4.50Mb
    
    OK (2 tests, 5 assertions)
    
    Writing code coverage data to XML file, this may take a moment.
    Code coverage 12/12 (100%)

You see here that it automatically find the tests, run them and
perform a code coverage analysis of your code.

A couple of options are available if you want to run You 

# How to Write the Unit Tests

First you need to know a bit [PHPUnit][phpunit], because this is the
framework used to write the tests. The choice of *PHPUnit* was
influenced by the active development and ecosystem around this
framework. Basically, this is the standard unit testing library for
PHP and it had the nice idea to decrease its level of bloat for the
programmers in the last release.

The simplest test is a `tests.php` file in your application folder,
for example: `yourproject\apps\helloworld\tests.php`. Just put:

    <?php
    namespace helloworld\tests;
    class MySimpleTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        /**
         * Simply test that foo returns true.
         *
         * It does not try to retrieve the data afterwards.
         */
        public function testHelloFoo()
        {
            $this->assertEquals(true, \helloworld\hello\Base::foo('yeah'));
        }
    
        /**
         * Simple failed test.
         */
        public function testHelloFailed()
        {
            $this->assertEquals(true, false);
        }
    }

Then run:

    $ photon runtests

and enjoy the testing. What you need to notice is:

- you extend `\PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase` and not
  `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase`. The backslash in front is important as
  the class lives in the global namespace.

- you can also have more test namespaces, as long as they are sub
  namespaces of 'yourapplication\tests` and the files in the
  `yourproject/apps/yourapplication/tests/` folder.

At the end, you write your tests exactly as you would write them with
[PHPUnit][phpunit]. You can even run *PHPUnit* yourself from the
command line to test your application. This is very important to allow
you to reuse code from other projects into your own **Photon**
projects. That is, **Photon** will not force you to rewrite your tests
just to go well with it. **Photon** is just bootstrapping *PHPUnit*
for you.

# Complex Unit Tests

In the real world, unit tests need to interact with your database,
other web services and maybe other Ã˜MQ components. This means that you
need to provide your unit tests with some special configuration. You may also want to run some complex operations at the start of the tests.

By default, **Photon** uses:

- `config.test.php` file in your project folder for your project configuration;
- `photon/testbootstrap.php` to setup the auto loading of the classes and load your configuration.

You can use different configuration files, to run your tests with
different setup, by using the `--conf` option, for example:
`--conf=other/config.test.php`. For a small level of security, if the
configuration file is named `config.php` the tests will not run. This
is just to avoid you the bad luck of running your tests with your
production settings by mistake...

You can use a different bootstrap file with the
`--bootstrap=path/to/bootstrap.php` option. 

# Self Testing of Photon

To test your **Photon** installation, you can run the self test procedure:

    $ photon selftest

if you find a bug in **Photon**, please run the self test procedure
and if you can write a test to showcase the bug, then, you are going
to make the developers very happy!

[xdebug]:
